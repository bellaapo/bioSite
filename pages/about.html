            <p>Rayce is a 21-year-old college student currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration. He is drawn to this field due to its diverse career opportunities and has set his sights on becoming an accountant or a professional in a related area. Driven by discipline and a clear focus on his goals, he is committed to excelling in his studies to ensure he stays on a path toward his career aspirations.</p>

            <p>In addition to his academic pursuits, Rayce has a deep passion for disc golf, a sport he began playing in April 2022. His love for the game goes beyond just physical activity; he is captivated by the nature aspect and particularly enjoys observing how the discs fly and how far he can throw them. This connection to the outdoors is further reflected in his interest in exploring nature, with canoeing on the Silver River in Ocala with our father being one of his most cherished experiences.</p>

            <p>Another unique hobby that Rayce has cultivated is his interest in frogs. This fascination started in first grade when he learned about the tadpole growth cycle, and it has grown into a special talent for identifying different frog species. His keen eye for detail allows him to recognize various frogs based on characteristics like size, coloration, and vocalization.</p>

            <p>Dogs also hold a significant place in Rayce’s life. Growing up with multiple dogs throughout his life, he cannot imagine his life without them. They provide him with invaluable companionship that cannot be replaced. One of his fondest memories is playing with our dog Bean when he was a puppy.</p>

            <p>Describing himself as curious, passionate, and driven, Rayce is not only dedicated to his studies but to the people and activities that he loves. He holds the values of kindness and respect, guiding him to be a good person in all his interactions, whether with friends, family, or strangers. With a bright future ahead, Rayce is very focused on achieving his goal of graduating with a bachelor’s degree in the next few years, ready to make his mark in the professional world.</p>
